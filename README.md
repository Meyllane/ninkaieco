# NinkaiEco
NinkaiEco is a PaperMc plugin made for the French Minecraft RP server "Ninkai", heavely inspired by the manga Naruto. The aim of the plugin is to handle all the economical aspects of the project. 

## Features
- A "remote account" on which the monthly salaries are sent automatically. It takes in account the military rank of the character and their rank in their secondary occupations.
- A set of commands to convert a part of this account money to minecraft items, with custom textures, names and relores.
- A system of "orders" for the craftmen, with a modulable margin to set on each sells.

## Contributing to the code
The project was created with Gradle, and should be quite easy to install on your own machine. Just clone the repo, and you should be good to go.
